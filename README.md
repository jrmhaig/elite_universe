# Elite Universe

Generate planets and galaxies following the Acornsoft Elite planet generation
algorithm.

## Usage

```ruby
require 'elite_universe/planet'

planet = EliteUniverse::Planet.new(44344, 5276, 5405)
planet.name                      # = Lave
```

```ruby
require 'elite_universe/galaxy'

galaxy = EliteUniverse::Galaxy.new(23114, 584, 46931)
galaxy[129].name        # = Zaonce
```

`EliteUniverse::Galaxy` is an Enumerable class and so, for example, a full list
of planet names in the galaxy can be generated with:

```ruby
galaxy.map(&:name)
```

## Why

Some years ago I had a need to generate names for devices on a network for
which I only had was their [MAC addresses.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address)
As it happens, a MAC address is made of up 6 octets, which is equivalent to
three 2-byte integers.

The number of unique planet names generated by the Elite algorithm is a long
way short of the 281,474,976,710,656 possible MAC addresses. I would guess that
there are a few thousand unique names, which was more than enough for my
purposes and I never encountered a duplicate.

This would have been immensely useful several years ago when I was trying to
hunt down scraps of this information from around the internet!
